# I believe it was not implemented in scikit-learn because in contrast with
# Random Forest algorithm, Isolation Forest feature to split at each node is
# selected at random. So it is not possible to have a notion of feature
# importance similar to RF.
#
# Having said that, If you are very confident about the results of Isolation Forest
# classifier and you have a capacity to train another model then you could use the
# output of Isolation Forest i.e -1/1 values as target-class to train a Random
# Forest classifier.
# This will give you feature importance for detecting anomaly.

# Despite all this the iForest is interpretable if its underlying principle is
# taken advantage of: that outliers have short decision paths on average over
# all the trees in the iForest. The features that were cut on in these short
# paths must be more important than those cut on in long decision paths.
# So here's what you can do to get feature importances:
